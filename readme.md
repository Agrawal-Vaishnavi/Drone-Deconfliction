# UAV Strategic Deconfliction System

This repository contains a Python implementation of a drone strategic deconfliction system. The system validates whether a planned drone mission can be safely executed without conflicting with other drones in shared airspace.

## Features

- **3D Spatial and Temporal Conflict Detection**: Checks for conflicts in both space and time
- **Safety Buffer Management**: Configurable minimum distance between drones
- **Trajectory Interpolation**: Calculates drone positions at any time during flights
- **Advanced Visualizations**: 3D static visualizations and 4D animations (3D space + time)
- **Comprehensive Conflict Reports**: Detailed information about detected conflicts

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- FFmpeg (for saving animations)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uav-deconfliction.git
cd uav-deconfliction
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make sure FFmpeg is installed for animation support:
- On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
- On macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- On Windows: Download from [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from drone_deconfliction import DeconflictionSystem, DroneTrajectory, Waypoint

# Create deconfliction system
system = DeconflictionSystem(safety_buffer=15.0)  # 15m minimum separation

# Define waypoints for primary mission
waypoints = [
    Waypoint(0, 0, 10),      # x, y, z coordinates
    Waypoint(50, 50, 20),
    Waypoint(100, 100, 15),
    Waypoint(150, 150, 5)
]

# Create mission trajectory
mission = DroneTrajectory(
    drone_id="my_drone",
    waypoints=waypoints,
    start_time=0,
    end_time=120  # 2-minute mission
)

# Check if mission is safe
results = system.check_mission_safety(mission)

# Print results
print(f"Mission status: {results['status']}")
if results['conflicts']:
    print(f"Found {len(results['conflicts'])} conflicts")
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
python drone_deconfliction.py
```

This will run the demonstration that:
1. Creates two scenarios (with and without conflicts)
2. Checks for conflicts in both scenarios
3. Generates 4D animations to visualize the drone trajectories and conflicts

## System Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Waypoint Class**: Represents a 3D point in space with an optional timestamp
2. **DroneTrajectory Class**: Defines a drone's path through a series of waypoints
3. **DeconflictionSystem Class**: Core system that evaluates mission safety

## How It Works

1. The system maintains a database of registered drone flights
2. For each time step, it interpolates the positions of all drones
3. It checks if the minimum separation distance is maintained at all times
4. It provides detailed information about any detected conflicts

## Visualization

The system provides two types of visualizations:

1. **Static 3D Plot**: Shows the trajectories and conflict locations
2. **4D Animation**: Shows the drones moving in time with conflicts highlighted

## Extending the System

To make this system scalable for real-world deployment with thousands of drones:

1. Implement spatial indexing (e.g., octree, R-tree) for efficient conflict detection
2. Use distributed computing frameworks for parallel processing
3. Add real-time data streaming capabilities
4. Implement a database backend for flight registration and conflict logging
5. Add machine learning for predicting and preventing conflicts
